# Introduction. Come for the community. Stay to rescue your content.

The author of this book, Victor Kane, got a big surprise in March, 2015. And another one just a few months ago.

He loves mentoring. He feels he can't mentor, though, without being involved in challenging software development projects. And that he can't really shine in development without being involved in mentoring (and learning from his students!). So in March, 2015, he signed on with [a major mentoring community website](https://www.codementor.io/victorkane) bringing together mentors and mentees, people seeking mentorship in all areas of programming and software development. He was accepted on the basis of his [ten years of Drupal development](https://www.drupal.org/u/victorkane), his 25 years of [software development and mentoring in general](http://awebfactory.com/) (topped off with almost a decade of real world Node.js server side development experience), and the publishing of the book [Leveraging Drupal](http://awebfactory.com/node/348), which shared a special methodology for Drupal web application and website development by bring software development process engineering and architecture into the mix. 

Expecting to be assisting mentees mainly needing help with Drupal projects, but avid to be involved in Full Stack Javascript concerns also, Victor was tremendously surprised to find that only a tiny minority of his mentees were concerned with Drupal.

The vast majority were mostly interested in Full Stack JavaScript. His experience can best be expressed by this pseudocode:

```
FullStack (Process Engineering = 
           Lean UX && Agile && Kanban && UML, 
           Devops = true) => { 
  (React && Redux || Vue && Vuex) && 
  Node && (Express || Hapi) && 
  (MySql || MongoDB || CouchDB) 
} 
```

Then, just a few months ago, another line was added to the pseudocode: 

People were calling for help based on a very simple question: 

> My Drupal web application or website is obsolete, what should I do? Should I upgrade to Drupal 8? Is it ready? What other alternatives are available?

The great surprise here was, upon presenting various alternatives (see Chapter 2), the great majority opted to migrate directly to a full stack solution. They wanted something like this:

```
FullStack (Process Engineering = 
           Lean UX && Agile && Kanban && UML, 
           Devops = true) => { 
  (React && Redux || Vue && Vuex) && 
  Node && (Express || Hapi) && 
  (MySql || MongoDB || CouchDB) 
} 

Drupal (legacy) => { FullStack() }
```

In short, they wanted to **rescue** their stuff and place it all in a modern, decoupled, API-First context.

Because it has become a tendency. Starting with the onset of 2017, approximately, something was changing, something was emerging. From the standpoint of a place like the mentoring community website, a crossroads in the IT forest, where all tendencies are immediately made apparent; just as Angular.js was king in 2015, and React.js in 2016, and Vue.js in 2017, also, with the onset of 2017, after a couple of years of not having had almost any requests for Drupal, Drupal was back. But not because people wanted to use Drupal, but rather because, in a nutshell, people wanted to get off the island, and not have to leave their stuff behind. 

People had come for the community. And now needed to rescue their content.

Hence the need for this book, and the tools, methods, process and code behind it.

All being served up to you, as you no doubt begin to ask the same questions.

Although this is a hands-on book, we do need to know what we're doing, so Section 1 deals with both a historical view of the real forces at work ..... as well as a look forward to how content rescue from the island can be achieved either all at once, or else in evolutionary stages.

In Section 2, we delve right into our DurableDrupal Content Migration case study, so you can too. You can follow each chapter, and links will always be provided to relevant repos.

Then...
